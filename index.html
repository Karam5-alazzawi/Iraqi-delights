                <p>
                Dolma is a beloved traditional Iraqi dish that showcases the rich flavors and culinary heritage of the region. It
                consists of vegetables like grape leaves, eggplants, bell peppers, and onions that are hollowed out and stuffed with a
                flavorful mixture of rice, minced meat (usually lamb or beef), herbs, and spices. What makes Iraqi dolma unique is the
                way it's cooked—layered tightly in a pot with slices of tomatoes or meat at the bottom, then simmered slowly in a tangy
                sauce made from lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, or tamarind. This slow cooking process infuses the dolma with deep,
                savory flavors, making it a centerpiece at family gatherings and festive occasions across Iraq.

                <h2 class="bs-title">Bacha</h2>
                <p>Bacha is a traditional Iraqi delicacy made from sheep's head and trotters, slow-cooked to tender perfection. This rich
                and hearty dish is known for its deep, savory flavors, often enhanced with garlic, spices, and sometimes lemon juice.
                Bacha holds a special place in Iraqi cuisine, especially during colder months and festive occasions, where it is enjoyed
                as a nourishing comfort food. The preparation requires patience and skill, as the meat and gelatinous parts are cooked
                until they become soft and flavorful, often served with warm bread or rice. Bacha not only reflects the resourcefulness
                of Iraqi cooking but also the cultural importance of communal meals and sharing.</p>

            <h2 class="bs-title">Masgouf</h2>
            <p>Masgouf is a traditional Iraqi dish that showcases the country's rich culinary heritage, particularly its love for
            fish. This dish features freshwater carp, which is marinated with a blend of spices, herbs, and sometimes tamarind,
            then grilled over an open flame or roasted until the skin is crispy and the flesh is tender. The preparation of
            Masgouf is often a communal affair, with families gathering around to enjoy the smoky, flavorful fish served with
            sides like rice, salad, and flatbread. The unique cooking method and the use of local ingredients make Masgouf a
            beloved staple in Iraqi cuisine, symbolizing both tradition and the bounty of Iraq's rivers.</p>
